      <h2>Welcome to My Website!</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Aakash Kapadia, a highly motivated and results-driven professional with a Master's in Management Information Systems from the University of Illinois at Chicago. With a solid foundation in Information Technology from Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, I bring a strong blend of technical skills and practical experience.
        I've excelled as a Data Analyst Intern at Navlakhi, where I enhanced overall productivity by 75% through web-based tool development and data-driven reporting. My passion for machine learning led to a successful project predicting postgraduate college options, showcased in an IEEE-Xplore published research paper.
        As a Backend Developer at AKVI, I streamlined inventory management, integrating Goods and Services Tax computations and improving work efficiency by 80%. My commitment to excellence is further demonstrated through projects like 'CareerSpace' and 'Spotify Stream Prediction,' where I leveraged technologies like SQL, Python, and machine learning algorithms.
        I'm not just a technologist; I'm a proactive leader, serving as Senior Organizational Manager and Publicity Head at IETE-TSEC, and winning the VCET Hackathon 2022 with the 'CareerSpace' project. With a proven track record of success, technical expertise, and a passion for innovation, I am eager to bring my skills to contribute effectively in dynamic and challenging environments.
